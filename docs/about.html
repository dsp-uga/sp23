								<h2>Overview</h2>
								<p>
									<span class="image right">
										<img src="images/data_everywhere.jpg" alt="" />
									</span>
								</p>

								<p>
									This course aims to provide students with real-world data
									science experience. Students form teams, design data science
									pipelines from the ground-up, and compete to achieve the
									highest validation accuracy on a hidden test set.
								</p>
							</section>

							<hr />
							<section>
								<h2>Prerequisites</h2>

								<p>
									Machine learning, statistics, linear algebra, and software
									engineering knowledge are essential. Courses that would
									satisfy these prerequisites include:

									<ul>
										<li>
											<a href="http://www.cs.uga.edu/courses/csci-43806380">CSCI 4380/6380</a>
										</li>
										<li>
											<a href="https://www.capa.uga.edu/cgi/Capa/BrowsePrefix_DisplayCourse.exe?32634I32634">CSCI 4360/6360</a>

								<h2>Grading</h2>
								<p>
									<span class="image right"><img src="images/relevant_interests.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								</p>
								<p>
									Projects: 100%
								</p>
								<p>
									That's it. Projects are all this class is.
								</p>
								<p>
									That said, <strong>project != model accuracy</strong>. There's a lot more
									to building machine learning models than just tuning the accuracy through
									theoretical insights and architectural tweaks. This class is going to bring
									those other issues to the forefront--you ignore them at your own peril.
								</p>
								<p>
									Each project will consist of some intertwining objectives:
									<ul>
										<li>Machine learning model design and accuracy (yes this is a part, but just one part)</li>
										<li>Design choices, software design (software engineering)</li>
										<li>Documentation, tests, repository organization, continuous integration (open source development)</li>
										<li>Lightning talks (5-min elevator speeches)</li>
										<li>Postmortem (critical assessment of successes and failures)</li>
									</ul>
								</p>
								<p>
									Underlying each project is a theme of <strong>teamwork</strong>. You'll be 
									assigned random 3-4 person teams for each project (except the last, more
									on that later). You will need to <strong>work together</strong> to succeed, as
									these projects are far too large for one person to handle on their own.
								</p>
								<p>
									Teams will start with a grade of 85% (B); provided their solution 
									adheres to a baseline standard, that is the grade they will receive. 
									For more points, teams must go "above and beyond" the baseline.
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>The baseline theory grade will entail implementing the suggested 
											strategy in each project handout. This will usually be a simple 
											algorithm that, if correctly implemented, will confer a reasonable 
											test performance.</li>
										<li>The baseline engineering grade will entail i) well-designed, 
											modular code, ii) good documentation (in the code, in a README 
											file, and on the GitHub wiki), and iii) effective team dynamics 
											(division of labor in a CONTRIBUTORS file, good use of git commit 
											comments, use of GitHub issue tracker).</li>
									</ul>

									Examples of going "above and beyond" include, but are not limited to i) 
									implementing a sufficiently different algorithm (cite the paper), ii) 
									obtaining outstanding test performance, iii) using continuous integration 
									tools, iv) designing unit tests, v) a permissive open source license 
									(in a LICENSE file), vi) a project website, vii) using linters to adhere 
									to style standards, viii) creating and successfully hitting milestones 
									in the issue tracker, ix) packaging your project for distribution (e.g. 
									through pip or conda-forge), or x) providing outstanding documentation 
									(e.g. usage examples, install instructions, a "quickstart" guide, 
									comparison to other similar methods, etc).
								</p>
								<p>
									There will also be an introductory "Project 0" that aims to familiarize 
									students with the technical infrastructure of the course; this is required 
									but will not be graded.
								</p>
								<p>
									In addition to each project deliverable, teams will also be required to 
									<strong>peer evaluate each other's deliverables</strong> (don't worry, 
									evaluation checklists will be provided that you can fill out). Each 
									team will read over the other team's theory, repo (code + docs + 
									tickets + wiki + README + LICENSE + unit tests + whatever else they 
									provide!), and provide feedback on where they did well and where 
									(and how) they can improve.
								</p>
								<p>
									Finally, there will be <strong>lightning talks</strong> after each project. 
									Each team will be given <strong>5 minutes</strong> to give a talk / presentation / 
									demo on their submission. I strongly encourage you to focus on <em>your work</em>, 
									rather than the problem (since everyone's problem is going to be the same!). 
									What did you try? What worked? What didn't? Why? What would you do differently 
									next time?
								</p>
								<p>
									The final (4th) project is identical in scope to the other three, with two
									important differences: i) teams will be chosen by the students (instead of
									randomly assigned), and ii) the topic will also be selected by the students.
									Additionally, there will be copious opportunities for extra credit. The
									project will consist of four components:
								</p>
								<p>
									<ul>
										<li>Proposal: A 1-page (maximum) proposal outlining i) the basic data 
											science problem being looked at (type of problem, dataset to use, 
											previous attempts at solving the problem, and outline of the team's
											approach to solve it), ii) expected outcomes, iii) how success will
											be evaluated, and iv) who the members of the team are.</li>
										<li>Interim Updates: 5-minute lightning talks on the progress of the project
											at certain milestones. Special attention should be paid to highlighting
											progress by the team on their core objectives (i - iii above).</li>
										<li>Final Presentation: A 25-minute talk on the full scope of the project
											at its conclusion. Special attention should be paid to evaluating what
											worked, what didn't, and why.</li>
										<li>Deliverables: All the code and other materials should be made publicly
											available on GitHub for full evaluation.</li>
									</ul>

								<h2>Attendance</h2>

								<p>In short, I don't have an attendance policy. You're all adults.</p>

								<p>
									In general, I don't care whether you attend lecture/office hours or 
									not. I try to make lectures helpful and engaging, but if you need 
									(or want) to be elsewhere, that's perfectly fine. <strong>Don't 
									ask permission</strong> if you can skip class; instead, just 
									<strong>tell me that you intend to skip</strong> so I don't 
									worry about you. <strong>ESPECIALLY</strong> don't ask permission
									if you're sick--<strong>STAY HOME</strong> until you're well!
								</p>

								<p>
									That said, there are two exceptions: i) guest lecturers,
									and ii) lightning or project talks by your fellow classmates.
									With guest lecturers, please make every possible effort to 
									attend class, but again there is no penalty for not attending.
									For lightning or project talks by your classmates, listening
									to talks is considered as much a part of your grade for that
									project as delivering your own talk, so yes: those are required,
									but OF COURSE you may skip for extenuating circumstances (personal
									appointments, health reasons, etc). You DO NOT need to tell me
									what these reasons are; I trust you as adults to decide where you
									need to be an why! Just <strong>let me know</strong> if you will
									be unable to attend a guest lecture / lightning talk.

								<h2>Materials</h2>

								<p>
									<span class="image right">
										<img src="images/grumpy_cat.jpg" alt="" />
									</span>
								</p>

								<h3>GitHub</h3>
								<p>
									All course materials will be posted here, and all project
									repositories should be created and maintained here (whether
									they are private or public is up to you, but they should
									be part of the course's GitHub organization account). You
									can access the organization account through this link:
								</p>

								<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
									<strong>
										<a href="https://github.com/dsp-uga">https://github.com/dsp-uga</a>
									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>
									The specific repository for the Spring 2023 course materials
									is located <a href="https://github.com/dsp-uga/sp23">here</a>.
								</p>

								<h3>AutoLab</h3>
								<p>
									This is where you submit the output of your code for each
									project. You can access it via the link:
								</p>

								<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
									<strong>
										<a href="https://autolab.cs.uga.edu/">https://autolab.cs.uga.edu</a>
									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>
									Remember: if you have problems accessing AutoLab,
									<strong>check that you're either on UGA's campus network or
									are connected to it via VPN</strong>. If neither of these
									are true,
									<a href="https://eits.uga.edu/access_and_security/infosec/tools/vpn/">you
										can check out EITS' instructions for getting set up with VPN</a>.
									If one of them IS true, let me know and we'll see about sorting
									it out.
								</p>

								<h3>Discord</h3>

								<p>
									This is where I make will make critical course announcements,
									so please ensure you are subscribed.
								</p>

								<p>
									This is the primary point of interaction for asking for and
									offering help. I will answer questions when I can, but also
									I encourage everyone to help each other out, too!
								</p>

								<p>
									Discord has apps for both Android and iOS, so you are welcome to 
									download them if you want! You are also more than welcome to access 
									Discord exclusively via the web. I would encourage you to check 
									Discord <strong>at least once every 24 hours</strong> so you 
									don't miss any critical announcements.
								</p>

								<p>
									I also get inundated with emails on a daily basis, so using
									Discord to ask questions effectively acts as a filter: I'll
									most likely respond to a Slack question more quickly than I
									would by email.
								</p>

								<p style="margin-left: 30px;">
									<strong>
										<a href="https://discord.com/">https://discord.com/</a>
									</strong>
								</p>

								<p>
									If you are not in the Discord server, contact me via email to 
									receive an invite link.

								<h2>Policies</h2>

								<p>
									<span class="image right">
										<img src="images/hermione.jpg" alt="" />
									</span>
								</p>

								<p>
									Projects are due by 11:59:59pm on the noted date; after that
									time, AutoLab will no longer accept submissions. Furthermore,
									no commits to GitHub repositories after the stated time will
									be considered when evaluating.
								</p>

								<p>
									If you run into problems with your teammates, you first need
									to work with them and determine a course of action that is
									beneficial for everyone. If you and your teammates are still
									unable to reach a consensus, I am happy to help. But the
									bottom line is: your entire team sinks or swims together.
									There are no individual grades on the projects, so work with
									each other, not against one another.
								</p>

								<p>
									The presence or absence of any form of help or collaboration,
									whether given or received, must be explicitly stated and
									disclosed in full by all involved, on the first page of their
									assignment ("I did not give or receive any help on this
									assignment" or "I helped [person] with [specific task].").
									Collaboration without full disclosure will be handled
									severely; except in usual extenuating circumstances, my
									policy is to fail the student(s) for the entire course.
								</p>

								<p>
									AI-based text or code generation (e.g., ChatGPT or Copilot)
									are, for all intents and purposes, the same as receiving help
									or collaboration from others. To put it another way: I don't
									distinguish between human or AI based help, and frankly it's
									just as easy for me to tell the difference. 
								</p>

								<p>
									The simple version is: don't copy code or even previous
									solutions. Given the nature of this course and the need for
									ground-truth data on the verification end, chances are high
									you can find similar projects in the wild. Resist that urge;
									it will be obvious, and we'll have to have an awkward
									conversation that won't end well.
								</p>

								<p>DO NOT COPY CODE. Don't do it.</p>
